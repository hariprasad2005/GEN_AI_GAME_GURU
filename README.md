# üïπÔ∏è Generative AI GameGuru Chatbot

## Overview

This project is a simple text-based **chatbot** designed to guide users through the process of creating a presentation about **Generative AI in Game Development using GameGuru**. The chatbot provides information about various aspects of integrating AI into game development, such as asset creation, level design, NPC dialogues, and sound effects.

The chatbot is implemented in **Python** and uses a basic command-line interface, making it easy to run without any additional dependencies.

## Features

- **Interactive Guidance:** The chatbot helps users step-by-step in creating a presentation about Generative AI in GameGuru.
- **Conversational Flow:** Handles user input dynamically and offers context-specific responses.
- **Simple and Lightweight:** No external libraries required‚Äîjust Python!

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: The entire chatbot logic is implemented in Python using simple condition checks and text processing.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3** installed on your system.
  - You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `gameguru_chatbot.py` file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-gameguru-chatbot.git
   cd generative-ai-gameguru-chatbot
   ```

2. Make sure Python is installed by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the chatbot script using the command:
   ```bash
   python gameguru_chatbot.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts in the terminal. Type "start" to begin the conversation.

3. Example interaction:
   ```
   GameGuru Generative AI Chatbot is now active! Type 'start' to begin or 'exit' to end the chat.
   You: start
   Chatbot: Welcome! Let's create a presentation on Generative AI in GameGuru. Would you like an introduction, or should we dive into examples of AI integration in game development?
   ```

4. To exit the chatbot, type "exit".

## Sample Output

```
GameGuru Generative AI Chatbot is now active! Type 'start' to begin or 'exit' to end the chat.
You: start
Chatbot: Welcome! Let's create a presentation on Generative AI in GameGuru. Would you like an introduction, or should we dive into examples of AI integration in game development?
You: introduction
Chatbot: Generative AI refers to AI models that can create new content like images, dialogues, and music. In game development, it automates asset creation, level design, and more. Shall we talk about asset creation next?
You: level design
Chatbot: AI can generate dynamic game levels based on player preferences or algorithms, making each playthrough unique. GameGuru supports importing AI-generated custom levels. Should we discuss NPC dialogues next?
You: exit
Chatbot: You're welcome! Good luck with your presentation on Generative AI in GameGuru. Goodbye!
```

## Customization

- You can modify the chatbot responses or add more topics in the `get_response()` function in `gameguru_chatbot.py`.
- Feel free to enhance the logic for more complex interactions or add additional features as needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors, make sure you are using Python 3.
- For input/output issues, ensure your terminal supports text input and output.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate with an AI API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) for more advanced conversational capabilities.
- Add a GUI interface for a better user experience.
- Expand the chatbot's knowledge base with more detailed information about GameGuru and Generative AI tools.
